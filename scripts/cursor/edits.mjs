// fork edits: the prose and script changes this fork makes to upstream's text
// on purpose — not vocabulary the port normalizes, but decisions upstream
// doesn't share (who the PM is, who pushes, where a bug is filed). each edit
// is an exact passage of the *ported* file and what it becomes, applied by
// scripts/port.mjs after every rewrite rule, so it survives a merge from
// upstream the same way a rule does:
//
// - `before` found → replaced by `after`
// - `after` already present → applied on an earlier run; nothing to do
// - neither → upstream reworded the passage: the port fails and names the
//   edit, and the fix is a new `before` copied from the new upstream text
//
// exact strings, not regexes: a prose edit should break loudly on any upstream
// rewording rather than half-apply. group by ticket; `why` is the reason the
// passage differs from upstream, kept short. PORTING.md → Hand-owned.
//
// E(file, before, after, why) — `file` is the ported path (skills/kru-<name>/…)
const E = (file, before, after, why) => ({ file, before, after, why })
